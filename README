== Running from source

You need Ruby and wxRuby to run the application from source code. Under MS 
Windows you may need MSVCP71.DLL. Once you have Ruby and RubyGems 
installed, you can install wxRuby with:

  [sudo] gem install wxruby

Then you can run the application from source with:

  ruby rxdataed.rb

In Linux, you can enable yourself to run the script as an executable from any 
directory changing its permissions and creating a symbolic link:

  chmod +x rxdataed.rb
  ln -s rxdataed.rb /usr/bin/rxdataed

And run it with:

  rxdataed


== Building the executable

To build the executable from source, you need rake and rubyscript2exe gems, 
which can be installed with the following command:

  [sudo] gem install rake rubyscript2exe

Then just call the build task:

  rake build

The output executable is called rxdataed in Linux and rxdataed.exe in 
Windows. I don't know how it is called in Mac, I believe it's rxdataed.app.
By default, rubyscript2exe will call the Linux executable as rxdataed_linux, 
but the Rakefile will rename it. You can run this executable in any computer 
without installing Ruby or the required gems. It would be nice if someone make 
an installer for Windows or Debian and RPM packages for Linux. I don't know how 
Mac applications are distributeds.


== Source packages

To create source packages from the rake tasks, you need archive-tar and 
archive-zip gems, installed by

  [sudo] gem install archive-tar archive-zip

And then running the archive task to create a tarball archive and the zip 
task to create a zip archive. 

  rake archive
  rake zip

The resulting file contains all the Ruby scripts, the Rakefile, the basic 
documentation and the MS Windows manifest.


== Internationalization

RXData Editor supports gettext, but you need the gem if you want to use a 
translation. To install the gem, use:

  [sudo] gem install gettext

Now RXData Editor will try to use your system language, and use english if it 
is not available. If you want to create a translation for your language, you 
can create the translation template with:

  rake updatepo

and then use a plain text editor or a GUI like poedit[http://www.poedit.net] 
to create a translation file in "po/[lang]/rxdataed.po", based in the template 
in "po/rxdataed.pot". Once you are done, you can convert the plain text into 
binary messages (mo) with the task:

  rake makemo
